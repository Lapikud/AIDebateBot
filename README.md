# AIDebateBot

### This is an ongoing project
The idea is to have a bot that can take part in debates against human speakers.
It would listen to their speech, transcribe it, formulate a response in a debate format
and use text-to-speech to give its own speech for the audience to hear.

**What I've learned so far:**
- How to apply my knowledge of Python
- How to use Faster Whisper AI model for transcription
- Why virtual environments are useful

**What I expect to learn:**
- How to make API calls to OpenAI
- How to use Text-to-Speech AI models like Kokoro

**Current progress:**
- It's possible to record human speech in english and have it transcribed to text files. Also displays it in console
- Started work on adding API calls to OpenAI to get a response

**Next up:**
- Improve code design
- Improve the API calls
- Add Text-to-Speech using Kokoro
- Add an interface to control the behaviour and actions of the program
- Improve the speed of transcription
